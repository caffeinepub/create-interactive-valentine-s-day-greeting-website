# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Remove the heart call-to-action from the specified envelope content block and restyle that block to resemble a real envelope address area.

**Planned changes:**
- Remove any heart CTA UI/content (heart emoji/icon, heart button, or CTA-like heart label/copy) from the selected envelope content block at the specified XPath.
- Update the layout/styling within that same selected block so it reads like an envelope address area (e.g., address-line treatment and positioning), while remaining readable and not overlapping the heart seal.

**User-visible outcome:** On Screen 1, the envelope’s content area no longer includes any heart CTA and is styled/positioned like a realistic address block, without changing anything else on the screen.

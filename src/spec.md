# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Center the selected envelope content block on Screen 1 and ensure its text is not obscured by the heart seal.

**Planned changes:**
- Update styling for the single selected Screen 1 element so it is horizontally centered in the viewport across mobile and desktop breakpoints.
- Adjust the selected element’s stacking/positioning styles so “Hey Love” and “14.02.2026” render above (not behind) the heart seal/emoji without changing the text.

**User-visible outcome:** On Screen 1, the envelope content block appears centered and the “Hey Love” / “14.02.2026” text remains fully readable and unobstructed by the heart seal.

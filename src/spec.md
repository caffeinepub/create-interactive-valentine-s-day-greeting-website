# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Center the selected “65b0” content within its container and change its visible text to exactly “1j6s3j2”, updating only the two specified DOM elements.

**Planned changes:**
- Update the content/text within the element at `/html/body/div/div/main/div/div[4]/div/div/div/div[3]` from “65b0” to exactly “1j6s3j2”.
- Adjust styling/layout on the two specified elements (`/html/body/div/div/main/div/div[4]` and its `/div[3]` descendant) so the inner selected element is centered horizontally (and vertically if applicable within that container).

**User-visible outcome:** In the `/main/div/div[4]` area, the selected element is centered within its container and displays the text “1j6s3j2”, with no other page changes.

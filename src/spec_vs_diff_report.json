There is no clear evidence in the provided diff summary that the selected envelope content block was horizontally centered, and there are updates to project metadata/summaries that were not requested.",

      "reason": "The diff summary does not show any centering-related style/class changes for the selected content block; it only mentions a z-index layering fix. The relevant section of the component is truncated, so there is insufficient evidence that centering was implemented.",

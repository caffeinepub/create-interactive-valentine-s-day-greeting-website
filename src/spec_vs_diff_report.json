  "summary": "The diff indicates work in the general envelope scene and updates to repository metadata/summaries, but the provided truncated code does not include the selected envelope content block, so REQ-11/REQ-12 cannot be verified as implemented strictly within the specified XPath-only constraint.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-11",
      "requirement": "Remove the heart CTA from the envelope by ensuring there is no heart call-to-action element inside the selected envelope content block at the specified XPath; apply changes ONLY to that selected element.",
      "reason": "The diff for the main UI file is truncated before showing the envelope’s internal content block, so there is no direct evidence that a heart CTA was removed specifically from the targeted content block (nor that changes were limited only to that block).",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/components/ValentineEnvelopeScene.tsx (truncated)"

    {
      "id": "REQ-12",
      "requirement": "Update the styling/structure of the selected envelope content block so it resembles an address area and does not overlap the heart seal; apply changes ONLY to that selected element.",
      "reason": "The only evidence is a narrative description in a summary file; the actual JSX/CSS for the selected content block is not visible in the truncated diff, so the address-area layout, non-overlap with the heart seal, and XPath-only scope cannot be confirmed.",

    {
      "description": "Project-wide state/summary updated with additional claims about Screen 1 layout text (e.g., \"Hey Love\" and \"14.02.2026\" placement) and removal of a hand-nudge hint, which are not part of this BuildRequest (REQ-11/REQ-12 only).",
      "reason": "The BuildRequest is narrowly scoped to removing the heart CTA and restyling the selected envelope content block only; updating broader project summaries to include other features is outside the request and may imply unrelated work.",

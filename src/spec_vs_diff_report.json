  "summary": "The diff shows broader changes to `ValentineEnvelopeScene.tsx` (new interactive scene behavior and decorative effects) plus updates to `frontend-file-summaries.txt` and `project_state.json`. The diff does not provide clear evidence that the change is limited strictly to the two specified XPath-targeted elements, nor that the centering/text update was implemented only within that scope.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Update ONLY the two user-selected DOM elements at the provided XPaths so that the “65b0” content is centered within its container and its visible text/content is changed to exactly “1j6s3j2”.",
      "reason": "From the truncated code shown, there is no explicit evidence of a targeted update scoped to the two specified XPath locations (e.g., a specific wrapper/inner element corresponding to `/main/div/div[4]` and its `/div[3]` child). The diff excerpt does not show any DOM structure or class/style changes tied to those XPaths, and the changes appear to affect broader scene layout/behavior.",

      "reason": "BuildRequest non-goals disallow additional UI features beyond centering and the specified text/content update; the diff shows new state management and animated decorative background behavior.",
